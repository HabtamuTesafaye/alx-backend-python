# Python Generators - `python-generators-0x00`

This project explores the use of **Python generators** to efficiently handle large data sets and streaming operations. By working with real-world data (CSV files), you'll build generator functions that simulate data pipelines, lazy pagination, batching, and streaming.

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

- Understand the concept of iterators and generators in Python
- Create generator functions using `yield`
- Stream data efficiently without loading it all into memory
- Implement batching and lazy loading techniques
- Simulate paginated queries and age-based data streams
- Write reusable and memory-friendly data utilities
